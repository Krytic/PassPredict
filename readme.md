    elevation_threshold=0                                                           # How far above the horizon (degs) a pass should be to be considered tweet-worthy
    tweet=In {} minutes, {} will be over UoA! Maximum elevation is {:.2f}Â° at {}.   # The content of the tweet.
    
    ## Celestrak Information ##
    celestrak_file=active.txt                                                       # The celestrak filename of the TLE files.

To run, invoke it from the command line:

    nohup python PassPredict.py & 

(This runs it as a background process, use `ps aux | grep PassPredict` to monitor it)

PassPredict will test your credentials and refuse to run if they are correct. By default PassPredict runs every 60 seconds (customisable, although is hardcoded in).

## Branch Policy
Master is considered to be bleeding-edge. Releases are tagged, please make changes on different branches and we will merge them to master as required.

We follow the [major.minor.patch](https://semver.org/) version schema, which will be introduced with version 1.0.0 (and will be tagged as such). Until then, consider this alpha software, or if you prefer a concrete version number, 0.1.0.
